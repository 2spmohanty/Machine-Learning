# Handling Categorical Data & Feature Interaction 

-----------

## **Learning Goal**: 

Master the art of data preprocessing and feature engineering to make a linear model work with "non-math" data.

-----------

## Concepts 

* **One-Hot Encoding**: Converted categorical text data (like 'Smoker' status and 'Region') into binary numerical values that a regression model can process.
* **Interaction Features**: Engineered new features (e.g., BMI * Smoker) to capture complex relationships where two variables combined have a massive impact on the target.
* **Advanced Feature Scaling**: Applied Z-score Normalisation to handle features with massive scale differences (Age vs. Annual Charges).
* **Learning Rate Tuning** : Experimented with different 
 values to find the "sweet spot" that allows for fast convergence without overshooting the minimum cost.

**Status:** **IN PROGRESS 🏗️**
