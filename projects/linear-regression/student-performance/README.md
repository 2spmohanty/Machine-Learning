# Multiple Linear Regression – Vectorized Implementation

## Learning Goal

Transition from single-variable linear regression to multiple linear regression using a clean numerical dataset.
Focus on implementing gradient descent efficiently and understanding model behavior.

- **manual_regression.ipynb**: Pure NumPy.
- **sklearn_regression.ipynb**: With Sklearn.

## Concepts Implemented

* **Vectorization**: Implemented the gradient descent update rule using dot products (
) for faster computation.
* **Cost Monitoring**: Learned to plot 
 vs. iterations to verify that the algorithm was converging correctly.
* **Weight Interpretation**: Observed how the model assigns higher 
 values to high-impact features (like 'Hours Studied') vs. lower-impact ones.
* **Baseline Performance**: Established a "best-case scenario" model using data that required zero cleaning.

**Status:** **COMPLETED ✅**
